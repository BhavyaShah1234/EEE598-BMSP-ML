# EEE598-BMSL-ML
This is the shared repository forEEE 598: Biomedical Signal Processing and Machine Learning class project in Fall 2025.
You can run the jupyter notebook for the deep learning modules, but the database needs to be downloaded first. This is true for both modules/scripts. 
For the classical ml models, run the'sleep_stage_detect_ml.py' script in the classical folder, the database loading is slightly different since patient id's were slightly modified. Humberto removed the last number at the end of the files in order to access them with py_edf_read.
